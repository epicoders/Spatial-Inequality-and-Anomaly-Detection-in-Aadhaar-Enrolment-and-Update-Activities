Problem Statement:

The project analyses Aadhaar enrolment and update activity across districts to identify:
Stagnation Zones
→ Districts with high population but consistently low Aadhaar activity, indicating systemic friction (access issues, centre closures, digital barriers).
Anomalous Spikes
→ Sudden, unusual surges or drops in enrolments/updates that deviate from normal
seasonal patterns.
The goal is to distinguish:
• Organic growth (e.g., awareness drives, policy changes)
• Systemic failures (e.g., infrastructure breakdowns, migration shocks)

Approach:

The approach combines:
• Spatial inequality analysis (Gini Coefficient & Lorenz Curve)
• Time-series anomaly detection (trend + seasonality decomposition)
